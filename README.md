# House Value Regression Model

This repository contains a Python program that trains a neural network to predict house values based on various input features. The model is built using the PyTorch framework and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyTorch
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these packages using the following command:

```
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning

The script includes a function for hyperparameter tuning:

```
RegressorHyperParameterSearch(train, test)
```
